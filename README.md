# GRIEF GAME

Trying to update it and make it better
Hope you enjoy!

The griever, who is what you play as, depicts a person's journey through the 5 stages of gried: truth, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.

Each level represents a creative depiction of each stage, and we hope that this was able to convey at least a fraction of what actual people go through.
