# COUNTERSPELL SUBMISSION
Submission for Team Buldak in Counterspell Bergen

Trying to update it and make it better
Hope you enjoy!

In our game, we decided that we are our own enemies in the sense of the 5 stages of grief

The griever, who is what you play as, depicts a person's journey through the 5 stages of gried: truth, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance.

Each level represents a creative depiction of each stage, and we hope that this was able to convey at least a fraction of what actual people go through.
